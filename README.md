# WaterWisePrototype

## Development of a Gamified Social Platform for Groundwater Conservation

### Overview
WaterWisePrototype is a gamified social platform designed to promote groundwater conservation through engaging and interactive tasks. Users can participate in water conservation challenges, earn rewards, and track their progress in real-time. The platform aims to educate and encourage sustainable water management practices.

### Features
- **Task-based Water Conservation Challenges:** Users complete real-world tasks related to water conservation (e.g., rainwater harvesting, reducing water waste) and share proof via pictures or videos.
- **Reward System with In-game Currency:** Users earn in-game currencies for completing tasks, which can be used to purchase digital rewards like stickers or badges.
- **Leaderboard System:** A daily leaderboard tracks user achievements based on task completion, encouraging competition and engagement.
- **Certificate-Based Milestones:** Users receive certificates after completing a certain number of tasks, acknowledging their contributions to groundwater conservation.
- **Real-time Progress Tracking:** Users can monitor their progress and compare with peers through live updates and rankings.

### Problem Resolution
- **Promotes Sustainable Water Management:** The game educates players on real-world groundwater conservation techniques, guiding sustainable decisions in scenarios like drought, surplus rainfall, and contamination.
- **Engaging Educational Tool:** It offers an interactive and fun way for schools and institutions to raise awareness about groundwater issues, with quizzes and certifications enhancing learning outcomes.

### Tech Stack

#### Frontend Development
- **React:** Utilized for building an interactive and responsive user interface for the web-based game & community platform.

#### Backend Development
- **Express.js:** Employed for creating RESTful APIs and managing server-side logic, enabling seamless communication between the frontend and backend.
- **Rocket.rs:** Web framework for Rust that is type-safe and secured.

#### Database Management
- **Surreal DB:** Multi-model database that combines the flexibility of NoSQL with the power of SQL for real-time, highly scalable applications. Can be run on bare metal or cloud, with support for ML.

#### Real-time Performance Optimization
- **Docker:** To ensure consistent environments and simplify deployment across multiple platforms.

#### Security and Authentication
- **JWT (JSON Web Token):** Implemented for secure user authentication.
